# 🕵️‍♂️ Online Fraud Detection Project

## 📝 Description

This project implements an online fraud detection system using PySpark and machine learning techniques to identify fraudulent transactions in credit card data.

## 🌟 Features
-
- Exploratory Data Analysis using PySpark and Plotly for visualizations. 📊
- Preprocessing and feature engineering to prepare data for modeling. 🔧
- Training machine learning classification models like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting. 🤖
- Model evaluation using AUC-ROC and Precision-Recall metrics. 📈
- User interface for data upload and result visualization using Streamlit or Dash. 🖥️
